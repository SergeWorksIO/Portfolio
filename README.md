### Professional Expereience:
<img src="/Assets/Atmosphere.png" width="80"> 

#### Atmosphere for Skylight @ Site 1001 (May 2019 - Oct 2019) iOS
Atmosphere is the mobile counterpart to the work order management module provided by Site 1001's  Skylight web application. 
It is a user permission-based and allows users to create, read, update, delete, and assign work orders.
Each work order can contain a detailed description of the location, task, and photos.
Atmosphere has two other alternative ways to create workers through the use of voice commands and QR codes.

#### Datapoint @ CEHPro (Mar 2019 - May 2019) iOS
Datapoint was an application designed to help the growth of small businesses.
Its goal was to take the information received through service estimate forms found on the landing pages of our partners (business owners) website and immediately notify them of potential clients.
The team was composed of two developers, my partner Clark Maxam who was in charge of the web development and business aspect of the project and myself responsible for the mobile and backend development aspect of the project.  Unfortunately, the project died in its early stages as we were both given the opportunity to work in fulltime jobs at different startups. Before the project came to an end we presented our clients (a pest control company and a small engineering startup) an interactive prototype of our mobile product as well as some of its implementation (splash, login, and news feed pages).


### Personal Projects:

#### Tunemachine (Nov 2019 - Oct 2019) iOS
Application is under development and specifics cannot be provided for monetization purposes.

#### Rage Cage (Aug 2018 - Dec 2018) iOS
Rage Cage was my first application deployed in the Apple App Store. It was a hyper-casual game in which a ping pong ball is bounced on a surface and attempted to fall in the opening of a line of moving cup stacks.
The nature of the game was very challenging and competitive and took inspiration from the famous game Flappy Bird. 
 This application was also my first attempt to advertise and monetize my work. The game managed to make me some money and gave me the satisfaction that different people around the world were using my product.
 
 ### School Projects:
 
 #### Cat Tracks (Aug 2018 - Dec 2018) Android
CatTracks was an application built with the purpose of providing students from the University of California Merced a fast and interactive way to read the school's bus schedule. The team was composed of four people; three mobile developers (Luis Mejia, Marylou Robles, and myself) and one backend developer (Kelvin Lewin). As experienced bus riders, our team was aware of the challenges that many students face when trying to use the bus to travel throughout the city of Merced. At the time of development the school provided students a web page containing pdfs of the bus schedule along with a map widget that was very hard to navigate on mobile devices. Our team came up with a simple solution in which users provide their current location and desired destination in the form of a bus stop name or nearest landmark. The application then presented the bus lines connecting both locations as well as departure and arrival times.

#### GoToo (Feb 2018 - May 2018) iOS
GoToo was the project that introduced me to mobile development. It was also the first time I  collaborated with a group of developers to try to tackle a bigger problem.  It was a long shot since no one in the group really knew about mobile or backend development. However, it was a great introduction to what actually happens in the real world. There was a lot of planning, prototying, presenting and of course developing. I faced many challenges during this journey but at the end of the day, I knew that mobile development was the career for me.
The goal of the application was to create virtual communities among students that have the same classes and to provide them with several forms of communication that they can use to collaborate and help one another. Our application followed the doctrine that collaboration is the best way to solidify knowledge.
