#### Atmosphere for Skylight @ Site 1001 (May 2019 - Oct 2019)
Atmosphere is the mobile counterpart to the work order management module provided by Site 1001's  Skylight web application. 
It is a user permission-based and allows users to create, read, update, delete, and assign work orders.
Each work order can contain a detailed description of the location, task, and photos.
Atmosphere has two other alternative ways to create workers through the use of voice commands and QR codes.

#### Datapoint @ CEHPro (Mar 2019 - May 2019)
Datapoint was an application designed to help the growth of small businesses.
Its goal was to take the information received through service estimate forms on the landing pages of our partners (business owners) website and immediately notify them of potential clients.
The team was composed of two developers, my partner Clark Maxam who was in charge of the web development and business aspect of the project and myself responsible for the mobile and backend development aspect of the project.  Unfortunately, the project died in its early stages as we were both given the opportunity to work in fulltime jobs at different startups. Before the project came to an end we presented our clients (a pest control company and a small engineering startup) an interactive prototype of our mobile product as well as some of its implementation (splash, login, and news feed pages).
